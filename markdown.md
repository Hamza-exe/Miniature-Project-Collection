
**Minecraft, A Newbies Guide**

Minecraft is a large open-area game that has unlimited possibilities on how you play it. The 3D blocky game may not be visually pleasing, but what you can do with the game makes up for it. You can build any structure you like, beat the game, and survive with many different modes to play on. Creative mode allows you to have access to all different materials in the game to build with, and many different weapons to destroy with. Survival mode allows you to enter a flourished world with adventure and treasure of all sorts. Your tasks are to survive and grow your presence in this new world. This strategy guide will lead you through the challenges and foes of the game strategically while allowing you to enjoy playing along the way.

**What you need to get started:**

To play Minecraft, you need to purchase the game on the platform you are using. For computer users, visit the Minecraft.com website and purchase the game. From there you start the launcher and the game is ready to be played. For mobile users, visit the app store and purchase the game and download it. All console users are required to either purchase a hard copy of the game for their platform or purchase a digital copy from their game store. 

**Starting the game**

Once you launch and start a new game, you are transported to a world with no materials or weapons on hand. To start your journey, the most common and easy approach is to start and collect some wood. 

Step 1. Find the nearest tree and destroy it by pressing the corresponding destroy button on the platform you are using. Collect a good sum of around 20 blocks

Step 2. Once you have the blocks, use the in-menu crafting option and create wooden planks to create a crafting table. To craft a crafting table, you need 4 wooden blocks.

Step 3. Create some weapons and tools to help you in the game. Create an axe to cut down more trees, a sword to hunt for food and defend, or a pickaxe to collect raw metals and materials such as rock. 

**Weapons **

There are many craftable weapons in Minecraft. Some with materials rarer and more difficult to extract than others. The weapons included in Minecraft are composed of sets created from the same materials. 

These sets include:



* A farming hoe
* A pickaxe
* An axe
* A sword
* A shovel

These weapon sets all have different uses and can all be used to inflict damage. The pickaxe is used to extract resources from caves, the axe is used to harvest wood and break wooden products, the sword is used to kill creatures, the farming hoe is used to farm and create agriculture, and the shovel is used to destroy the terrain and extract dirt. All of these tools and weapons have different damage points since all can be used to defend. The weapon's damage increases between different weapon sets of different materials. The set that inflicts the most damage is the diamond weapon set. They are weapons created from rare diamonds that are extracted from deep caves. The weakest weapon set would be the wooden set since its material is not very durable and easy to source. 

The hierarchy of the weapon sets goes from least inflicting damage to most inflicting damage:



1. Wooden weapons set
2. Stone weapons set
3. Iron weapons set
4. Gold weapons set
5. Diamond weapons set

The stone weapons sets are created from locally sourced rock found everywhere while iron and gold weapon sets are created from gold and iron ore that is smelted in furnaces to create the raw ingots needed.

**The Monsters**

There are monsters constantly trying to kill you in Minecraft. They all have different ranging powers and abilities. The Zombies in Minecraft come out at night and kill in groups, while the Skeletons use their bow and arrows to shoot you down. The Creeper is a green monster that blows up when it comes in contact with you, killing you immediately. The Spider is hostile at night but does not attack in the daytime. The Enderman is a tall, black, humanoid figure that attacks anyone that looks into its eye. It teleports all around to kill you and steals blocks as well, being able to break structures while roaming.
