                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Hamza Elafifi. I’m 15 years old and come from Egypt. I am attending my high school years in Winnipeg and I’m planning on attending university in Ontario to receive my medical degree and become a neurosurgeon. I have many things that inspire me in my everyday life. Sports are a major thing due to my athleticism and genetics, that I have become fond of Basketball, Swimming, Boxing, and weight-lifting. I am also heavily inspired by business because I had found myself really interested in the system of sacrifice and risk which can bring out success in return.

                    I grew up in Kuwait and Egypt during my early years as a kid and moved to Canada in mid-2010. I used to live in Ontario and moved to Manitoba 7 years ago and enjoy the quiet and spacious life here. I am part of a family of 6 with a brother and 2 sisters. My parents work in the healthcare industry and my siblings are still in elementary school. Most of my larger family live in Egypt, while others in Germany and in the U.A.E.
                    
                    I Enrolled in the Software development program because I believe that this skill is quite useful in all aspects of this time. Technology has become a major thing in society where it is needed to carry out many functions. I want to use this newly founded skill of mine in the future and integrate it with my preferred future job as a neurosurgeon and create things such as applications and machine code. I also find it very fun to create programs and games that include complex functions and great design.
                    
                    I have many hobbies that I find to be a very good use of my time. My hobbies include refurbishing old electronics as well as fixing their electronic components. I also love to create props from movies and shows as well as costumes. I refurbish my shoes, such as my Jordans because they are very precious to me. Drawing is also a hobby of mine but not as much as the others that I mentioned because I found myself not finding enough spare time to fit in this hobby.
